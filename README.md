### Overview
We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance<br/>

### Objectives
# KPI Requirement 
We want to calcualate following metrics:<br/>
1. Total Revenue -> The sum of total price of all pizza orders.<br/>
2. Average Order Value -> The average amount spent per order, calculate by dividing the total revenue by the total no of orders.<br/>
3. Total Pizzas Sold -> The sum of quantities of all pizzas sold.<br/>
4. Total Orders -> The total no of orders placed.<br/>
5. Average Pizzas Per Order -> The average amount of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total no of pizzas sold by the total no of orders.<br/>

# Charts Requirements
We would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. We have identified the following requirements for creating charts:<br/>
1. Daily Trend for Total Orders -> Create a bar chart that displays the daily trends of total orders over a specific time period. This chart will help us identify any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis.<br/>
2. Hourly Trend for Total Orders -> Create a line chart that illustrates the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart will allow us to identify peak hours or periods of high order activity.<br/>
3. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category -> Create a Pie chart that shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. This chart will provide insights into the popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales.<br/>
4. Percentage of Sales by Pizzas Size -> Generate a Pie chart that represents the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes. This chart will help us understand customer preferences for pizza sizes and their impact on sales.<br/>
5. Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category -> Create a bar chart that represents the total number of of pizzas sold by each pizza category. This chart will allow us to compare the sales performance of different pizza categories.<br/>
6. Top 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold -> Create a bar chart highlighting the top 5 best selling pizzas based on the total number of pizzas sold. This chart will help us identify the most popular pizza options.<br/>
7. Bottom 5 Worst Sellers  by Total Pizzas Sold -> Create a bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst selling pizzas based on the total noumber of pizzas sold. This chart will enable us to identify underperforming or less popular pizzas options.<br/> 

### Sample Insights
-> Orders are highest on weekends (Friday/Saturday)<br/>
-> There are maximum orders from 12-01pm & between 04-08pm<br/>
-> Classic category of Pizzas contribute to maximum sales<br/>
-> Large Size Pizzas contribute to maximum sales<br/>
-> The Peppeoroni and classic deluxe pizzas are the best sellers and revenue generators<br/>
-> The Brie Carre Pizza is the bottom in both orders and revenue
